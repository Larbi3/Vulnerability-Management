# Vulnerability-Management

Vulnerability management is the process of routinely identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities found within systems and the software running on them. It is a foundational component of security maintenance, and an essential step for strengthening an organization’s security posture. The main objective of vulnerability management is to reduce potential avenues of exploitation by attackers. 

Below is a simplistic step-by-step guide to follow when practicing system scans for vulnerabilities.This just to give you an idea of the fundamentals behind vulnerability scans. When referring to this, please feel free to test different methods of creating potential compromises to the system and resolving the vulnerabilities found.


**Step 1: Set up the Virtual Environment**
Download and install VMware Workstation Player
Download Windows 10 ISO
Create a new VM within the player and install the ISO
After configuring the settings, launch the VM and set up Windows 10 pro 
**Step 2: Install the Vulnerability Scanner Nessus Essential**
Register for an activation code which will be sent to your email
Go through the process of setting up Nesses which will lead you to localhost URL
**Step 3: Test Reachability**
Within the VM, open command-line and type ipconfig to obtain the IPv4 Address
Open PC command-line and ping the IPv4 Address. If the request is timed out, open wf.msc and disable all firewalls within the VM allowing it become reachable 
**Step 4: Conduct Vulnerability Scan**
On the web app, create a new scan
After naming the scan make the target the IPv4 Address
Launch the scan make note of the generated vulnerabilities
**Step 5: Rescan the system with Credentials (Optional)**
Enable the Remote Registry to automation in the VM’s Services.msc so the scan can connect to the registry
In the Control Panel under advanced sharing settings, enable file and print sharing
In User Account Control Settings, move slider to never notify
Open regedit and create a new DWORD name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system which is a key that will allow credentialed scans against Windows host that are not on the Domain
Restart the VM 
Configure the scan credentials on the web app by entering the host username and password 
**Step 6: Perform the scan**
Compare the results of the credential scan to that of the non-credentialed scan
You should be privy to more vulnerabilities since the scan is allowed to view more on the system since it has credentials 
**Step 7: Create Vulnerabilities and scan system (Optional)**
One method of doing this is to install a deprecated Firefox on the VM
**Step 8: Resolve Vulnerabilities and rescan system (Optional)**
In this instance, removing Firefox should suffice
Updating the system show help to resolve additional vulnerabilities within the system 
Review results of scan to see if results are as expected
